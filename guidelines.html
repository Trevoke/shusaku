            <h2>How to start your review</h2>
       </header>
       <article>
           <p>Make sure your reviews go in a separate SGF file. It's very hard to do an effective synthesis if everyone's comments are all jumbled together.</p>
           <p>If the starting point SGF is provided on OGS, make a new review.</p>

            <header><h2>How to write your comments</h2></header>
            <p>Consistency in comments is very important. Readers want to be able to expect certain meaningful symbols. Here is how the SSP will format its comments.</p>
            <ul>
            
            
                <li>Don't use the OGS draw tool, it's not compatible with other SGF clients.</li>
                <li>Write coordinates as <b>S11</b>, not s11</li>
                <li>Write player colors as a single upper-case letter, e.g. <b>W</b>, not w, not white</li>
                <li>Intersections marked with a triangle represent forcing move for the player whose turn it is</li>
                <li>Wrap your comments with (replace PJ with DOP or Reading as necessary):<br/>
                    PJ<br/>-----</br/>
                    Your comments here<br/>
                    -----<br/>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <header><h2>When you have questions</h2></header>
            <article>
                <p>Put them in the corresponding channel, and try to answer them during the week with someone else from the project!</p>

    <header><h1>The three frames of analysis</h1></header>
    <p>The three frames are: Positional Judgment (PJ), Direction of Play (DOP), and Reading.</p>
    <p>Watch the primer on the 3-pass analysis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtWVGiXSmq4">here</a>.</p>

        <section>
            <header><h2>Positional judgment</h2></header>
            <article><ul>
                <li>status of all groups (how many eyes, is it sealed in)</li>
                <li>what big areas exist on the board</li>
                <li>what forcing moves exist on the board for the player whose turn it is</li>
                <li>where the territory is</li>
                <li>where the thickness is</li>
                <li>how many points both players currently have</li>
            </ul></article>
        </section>
        <section>
            <header><h2>Direction of play</h2></header>
            <article>
                <p>Think about desirable changes for the player whose turn it is. Which forcing moves do we want to use? When? Would using a given forcing move disable other forcing moves that we might want?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>which changes would the player whose turn it is like to see on the board</li>
                    <li>what sequences of forcing moves are available and how would they transform the board</li>
                    <li>is a gote move required or desirable now and why</li>                    
                </ul>
                <p>Would the player whose turn it is like to end with territory? Influence? Two eyes? A moto? Keep the opponent disconnected? </p>
                <p>What results are available on the board.. and what will happen if we play things in a different order? Are we going to lose forcing moves, give sente, something else?</p>
