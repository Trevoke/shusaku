W is more solid, though B threatens to seal W D17 in.

W has several forceful counterattacks on B's group, but E12 allows B to run out.
The turn at G15 is powerful against both of B's groups while also allowing W into the center.

Group 1 is weakened.

If group 2 gets to make a base or extension on the top, group 3 will be very uncomfortable.
-----

DOP
-----
While group 3 is not completely stable, it is stronger than group 2, so squeezing 2 in order to strengthen 3 is a good idea, especially because it gives W a stone on the top towards the corner.

Extending group 1 is completely gote at the moment so it's uninteresting.
-----]
;W[jd]LB[cb:1][ce:2][gd:3]
C[PJ
-----
Group 1 can live because of B17 forcing move, and can get to the center
Group 2 has eye shape and is out to the center
Group 3 remains light because the pincer is high: B can slide at K18

Making a base with 3 is painful because W's follow-up on the outside is too good.
-----

DOP
-----
We're in a contest for power at the moment, not yet a fight, so B can't let W connect / turn at G15, and B must avoid getting sealed in, so a move towards the center makes sense

C[PJ

W has played a bit lightly in order to create eyeshape along the side.

While not completely alive, it is difficult for B to kill this group currently. B has forcing moves, but is not strong enough in the top right corner to kill W outright.

B has a single eye with the J16 group, but is also out into the center, so it is not urgent yet for B to help this group, therefore B can easily tenuki.

Group 1 can still live after *passing*.
The resulting influence on the outside for B would be significant.

The top right is the next area where strength/points balance can be meaningfully adjusted on the board, though.
-----

DOP
-----
Because C8 is not sente against group 1, W can tenuki and approach another corner. Poking at the top right corner gives the best options for organic development.

W tenuki anyway, challenging the territory/strength value of the top right. If group 1 is able to build strength, B's center domination will be severely compromised.

This double high approach is severe. B has few options to make good shape in the corner without allowing W to form a strong outside, and using brute force to get out will concede the corner to W with poor shape for B.

Pushing through the elephant jump seems like a dual attack, but W's M16 group is relatively strong and the Q14 stone is light. This push looks more severe than it is as it does not help B's corner much and follow-ups against Q14 are not very strong.

This move primarily serves to manage W's group connections.

W can live locally with M3, but allowing B the turn at M6 will give B too much strength and end any hope of an attack on the Q4 group.

In the words of The Offspring, "You gotta keep 'em separated."

Because B has forced W to settle the right side R6 group, W only needs to worry about the O4 group during this fight. Currently B's L5 group on the left looks strong, but as W runs out the defect at K5 may become a problem.

Presumably Shusaku played this move to pressure W stones. If B connects at L7, W can atari at O6, and connect out his groups. Then B's corner is weak. That being said W is not alive yet so the fight will be ok for B when B escapes at O9
