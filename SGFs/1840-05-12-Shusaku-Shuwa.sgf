Immediately breaking up the position here shows an active strategy by white.

A and B are a question of strategy.

A is more "normal" because black will be able to take a strong position on top or attack with good initiative from the left. 

B usually requires setup for central development.

With the left side value reduced, this move elevates the importance of the bottom and right sides as future areas of interest for both.

Played in rote, but the bottom is now the Largest and most important area to play.

;W[cn]
C[PJ
-----
A bit slow: Today, we would expect to see r3 or o3. As it stands the bottom right is the next biggest place to break. 

Side note: This stone does have *some* involvement in negotiations on the upper side between n17 and q16 as ladders from that part of the board will be in discussion with c6. This will depend a lot on joseki from the period, as well as their follow-ups and may apply less in today's metagame.
-----]
;B[gq];W[qn];B[mq]
C[PJ
-----
Better control toward the bottom than keima at o3.
-----

DOP
-----
It's worth noting that this formation greatly reduces the ability of the bottom side to expand dynamically toward the center, despite the 2 influence stones here. It would seem Shusaku is interested in some complications on the sides.
-----]
;W[qc]
C[DOP
-----
This is an idea carried over from Shuwa's favorite white strategy Amashi: 

The goal is 2 fold, he is planning to allow black to attack the topside (black will naturally take influence facing it in this variation) and resist the attack strongly toward the center. The second  mode is another concept called Amasu: i.e. to induce an overplay, or goad black into pressing this top group too hard so that the end result is amashite-utsu or korigatachi. 

See variation for wrong block. 
-----]
(;B[pc]
C[PJ
-----
Topside is more important than the right side (weak topside W group). B will have a more concise attack from the top than the right.

B would like to entertain a three-way attack, this direction is appropriate to make W's stones move toward each other, allowing B to leverage them simultaneously.

Now is a good time for our reader to pause and consider their own strategy for dealing with this board as W, then explore how Shuwa handles this position through the rest of the game.

With this move there is now pressure on W's 3 areas.

;W[qk]LB[cn:A][id:B][qk:C]
C[PJ

Here W is temporarily ahead by 2 points or so in territory. B has incredible potential given the bottom side, and topside attack. So B's lead is still comfortably ~20 points.
-----]
;B[ck]TR[gq][mq]LB[cn:A][id:B][qk:C]
C[PJ
-----
In tandem with limiting W's left side, B is also trying to use the 2 marked stones actively. W has 3 weak(ish) areas, marked with letters.
-----

DOP
-----
In line with the direction of Q17, B's trying to orient all of W's stones toward the center. If W has to play defense then it's impossible to win.

;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er];B[eq];W[dq]

Extending F2 was also possible.

In this case it appears W wants B to have a lingering weakness at E4, and deemed this more important than a local exchange to live then tenuki.

;B[fq];W[bn]
C[PJ
-----
The stone at C6 is still too valuable to sacrifice outright here. If W did, B would gain thickness on the left side, making everything in the center more difficult for W. This descending move has removed C9's connection to its closest B neighbor, isolating it from its allies.

A deep move.

PJ
-----
The meaning of this block is to secure eye-space on the bottom as well as profit for the F3 stones. Making this group strong/thick indirectly weakens W F7 and makes F9 stronger by default. If B omitted this move and continued from the center, W would be able to lean on the weaker B bottom group; Erasing B's potential profit there as well as weakening the F9 area indirectly, by making the W group stronger.

Takes territorial profit. 

"Backwards move" 

Idea seems to be to cover the marked triangle weaknesses, while removing eye-shape from W on the bottom side. Possibly he is trying to avoid complications because of handicap.
-----

DOP
-----
This is the first move that seems to struggle with consistency of the other moves. Its a backwards move -- meaning it is NOT moving in a forward/the right direction here. More consistent would be to cut at L7 or M8. This move lapses in tempo and game flow becomes a little better for W. Hard to say its game losing, B still has a lead, but it gives W chances on the board, and raises his morale.

An interesting choice.

Although R3 is big, H14 is also important. Again W intends to let B make the first move on the topside. I suspect this is Shuwas "test" for Shusaku. 

In practical play, W may exchange this for Q3, and then H14 to add a stone to strengthen the top while erasing the center moyo.
