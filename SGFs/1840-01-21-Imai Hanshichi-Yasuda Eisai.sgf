E4 played to avoid taisha and highlight bottom area of the board along with Q5

B chooses profit over influence, deferring the contest of areas of the board. Without komi, B can afford to play patiently.

C[PJ

W emphasizes bottom of the board as an area of influence.
-----

]
;B[dr];W[iq]
C[PJ
-----
B has effectively a settled corner at this point

W has an undercut bottom side, so J3 isn't exactly grabbing a base, but J3 is making it harder for B to step between J3 and Q5.

W is keeping options open for future exchanges

J3 treats E4 lightly.
-----]
;B[ce]
C[PJ
-----
Two corners left: top left and bottom right. Top left provides the simplest options for development. Again, B is patient.
-----]
;W[ch]
C[PJ
-----
B ~ 25 points
W -> 4

Left side potential is diminished

W plays consistently with Q5: we want the ability to exploit complications on this board, so we can't let B create insta-settled groups.
-----]
;B[cc]
C[PJ
-----
B chooses simplicity: the onus is on W to do something coherent with their stones.

;W[cb]
C[PJ

W gets a base.
B is stable: can make two eyes AND can run out.
Now W needs to choose what to do with C12
-----
]
;B[dd]
C[PJ
-----
B is set up as desired on this board: a few stable groups from which fights can be weathered.
Now Q3 is possible because all results are acceptable.
The upcoming exchange needs to end in sente for W, otherwise B will get to really grow the top-right shimari and negate a lot of W's efforts up until now.

W is consistent in his strategy of setting up for managing complications.

;B[bc];W[hc];B[pq]
C[DOP
-----
The last corner: the least "simple" place on the board to create a stable, settled position. B steps in to continue his strategy. W has to choose: R3 to settle, or a move towards the left to remain consistent.

Settling is unpleasant because it gives B an opportunity to extend from R16 in relative sente, and because it'll significantly weaken the J3 group.
-----]
;W[np];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]
C[PJ
-----
W announces that the right side will be contested. B needs to choose: more profit, or contest right side?

All of B's groups are settled.
-----

DOP
-----
B's moves on the right side aren't sente right now because W is thick.

Fix last questionable area for W. Fuseki is now over.

W has ~22 points

;B[er]
C[PJ
-----
B challenges C9's idea and takes a reverse-sente move (if W plays here, B must defend corner again).

This move also challenges E4 being treated lightly, and now asks W what his development plan is.
-----

DOP
-----
W needs to consider the health of J3 and C9 in his response, as well as creating a consistent framework with his stones.

H17 is now W's weakest group, so extending to the big area in sente.

C[PJ

W stabilizes the next-weakest area. Follow-up at R17 is enabled. This means W can now pincer in the top.

W prevents B from playing at R13 and getting a double-wing formation.

Now B protects against the R17 invasion and erases R14 / R11's usability towards the center.

B has two areas of unresolved pressure: K17 and C5.

W needs to worry about converting areas of the center into territory now.

B challenges all of W's stones and the entire strategy that W has employed so far.
If B connects back, it's impossible for W to make up the points he's missing right now.
