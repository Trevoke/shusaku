This kakari and ogeima was standard in handicap games during Shusaku's time.
-----]LZ[];W[dc]C[PJ
-----
W opts for a solid corner that can develop off of C6.

This was Dosaku's preferred pattern as W in 2-stone handicap games.
-----]LZ[];B[pq]C[PJ
-----
B occupies the final corner.
-----

DOP
-----
When B plays the 3-4 point the right side becomes the largest, and therefore most important side of the board. W should approach Q3 in order to prevent a large B framework.
-----]LZ[];W[qo]C[PJ
-----
W has a flexible position, creating small areas that can be traded.
-----

DOP
-----
The G3 stone is low and relatively close so a pincer makes sense to drive W toward the center. After a pincer, B can develop the lower side and will have a position to expand the upper right corner.
-----]LZ[];B[qm]C[PJ
-----
A kick at R4 is also viable here.

Yilun Yang says the rule for corners is simple:
1v1: can tenuki
2v1: don't tenuki
3v1: always tenuki

But those rules are for even games :)
-----]LZ[];B[mc]LB[cn:1][qf:2][qo:3]C[PJ

Out of the W groups that are in contact with B groups, group 3 is the only one that's pincered and can't insta 3-3 if it comes to it, so definitely the weakest group on the board

W leans to get out.
-----

DOP

W's moving West / South
-----]LZ[];B[pl]LZ[];W[om]LZ[](;B[ql]C[PJ
------
B chooses the steady move, I think because he didn't want an approach around R10/R11 to be severe. 

If B plays the more active move, W has stronger options -- See R6.
-----]LZ[];W[oo]LB[gq:4][pm:2][pq:3][ql:1]C[PJ

1 and 2 are strong shapes, but 3 is being damaged by 2. 
Group 1 is light.
The bottom side is low, so connection between 3 and 4 is possible.
-----]LZ[];B[mq]C[PJ
-----
B makes a base.

Note that B only has one weak group now, on the right side. W has three unsettled groups. B has played so as to make sure he can do as he likes on the right side and in the centre without running into trouble in either the North or South. 
-----

DOP
-----
W has forcing moves against the group in the corner in order to settle. If W can settle his group in sente he can begin an attack against the R8 stones. Whoever plays in the R11 area first will have a great advantage on the right side.

-----
Both group 1 and 2 is settled.
-----

DOP
-----
Now that the group is settled, W should be looking to extend from the R14 stone. This is doubly important because an extension for B is a severe attack on R14.
-----]LZ[];W[qi]SQ[cn][dc][gq][mc]MA[mr][nr][ns][or][os][ps][rg][rh][sg][sh]LB[nk:A][oi:E][om:1][pl:2][qc:D][qd:C][qi:3][rd:B]C[PJ
------
Group 1 is settled
Group 2 is now heavy

W is making base with R11 and removing B possible base.

We can say this is the end of the opening I think, so let's count.

B has 5-10 points in the bottom right, W has 5-ish points on the top right (I'm counting these as points for now because of the weakness of group 2). Other than that, B and W have made an equal number of big opening moves (marked with squares), and they each have a stable-ish group (1 and 2). W has less territory (and it's less solid), but you could also argue W's big opening moves are more efficient and less overconcentrated than B's, so I'll say it's even.

On the right side, B 2 is behind the sector line created by P7 and R11, but only by a little bit. If B pokes his head out with a move like A, then W 1 will be behind the sector line created by N3 and O9. So this looks like the beginning of a running fight. Group 3 can choose from moves B through E if necessary, so that group is stable for now.

Nobody seems to have made any bad exchanges or got any big advantages. B should still be ahead by the two handicap stones for now.

------

For reading: why is A connected?]LZ[];B[ol]LZ[]C[DOP
-----
Because W has settled both groups on the right and group 1 is difficult to attack, W should play on the most open side of the board, the left. A corner enclosure is the most important move in that area.
-----]LB[pl:1];W[ce]LB[dc:2][oo:1][pl:4][qi:3]C[PJ
-----
W goes for strength in the opposite corner and reaches for C6.

A shimari is ~12 pts.

Group 1 has two ways out, so not quite a clever rabbit, but not a dumb one either.

Shimari provides a third base of operation for W (1,2,3)
Group 4 is still on the heavy side.
-----]LZ[];B[rq]LB[oo:1]C[PJ
-----
Now group 1 is dead, it can't live locally.
-----

DOP
-----
Now that the option to live in the corner has been removed, W can not allow group 1 to be surrounded or curled up with a move like O7. W must move out toward the center.
-----]LZ[];W[nm]C[PJ
-----
Helps group 1 with as little help for group 2 as possible
-----

DOP
-----
B should move out group 2 in order to attack groups 1 and 3 at once while strengthening the weak stones.

Group 2 wants to get stronger by pressuring group 1, but it can use corner forcing moves, so pressuring it too much will be counter-productive, so A isn't a good option.

This move isn't strictly connected to the rest of the group, but it's not easy for B to cut because of the weaknesses on either side, it becomes very hard to evaluate. 

1 is a bit harder to harass now
2 and 3 are weak
-----

]LZ[];B[qe]LB[ol:2][pd:+][qf:1][qi:-]C[PJ
-----
This sequence closes a way to settle for group 1, squeezing it out for profit. Young Shusaku seems to like this pattern, we've seen this in other games already.
-----]LZ[];W[pf]LZ[]C[DOP
-----
B should continue the attack on group 1. An attack from the group 2 would push W to jump around O14 and the attack would quickly fizzle, leaving B with a weak group on the lower side and little profit on the top.

If B attacks from the top, W will be pushed toward B's thickness, building the top and allowing B to further move out the P8 group naturally.

I think it's ko at best here


PJ
-----
Reinforce corner territory and thickness, challenging top-left shimari


With this settling move, I count upwards of 25 solid points for B, and I count just under 20 for W.

(This count includes one of the handicap stones, but not the other, so for a proper count we should add those 10-15 points to B's advantage).

The areas marked with circles are places where W might get more points, but even with that I think W will need to take advantage of the imbalance between groups 1, 2, 3 to have any hope of winning this game
-----

DOP
-----
W needs to keep group 3 from being surrounded, it's also the only way to keep pressure on group 2, so W needs to move West with it.

]LZ[];B[ng]LB[mi:A][oh:B]C[PJ

This move effectively surrounds the W group by making miai of A and B. W needs to start thinking about how to live or sacrifice, probably by peeping the O8 weakness in some way.

This also develops thickness for B contesting the shimari in the top left.

This exchange is aji keshi as hell, but it cleanly fixes W's connection issues between the marked stones. B might cut off this M8 stone later, but it already served its function so whatever.

This move also secures life for the group.

-----]QKGV[1014:0.996898:22.476:17.7134::remote]LZ[];B[lk]QKGV[955:0.996617:22.2886:17.7865::remote]LZ[]LB[mk:2][pf:1]C[PJ
-----
The stones at 1 can be treated lightly, though W needs to handle the exchange carefully to limit B's strength: W cannot let B connect through.
-----

DOP
-----
It's hard to attack group 2 directly effectively. 
So we have to look for an alternative path. 
-----];W[lc]LB[mk:1][ni:2]C[PJ
-----
This change of direction is an extension of the fight between 1 and 2: preventing B from extending here makes it hard to reinforce B against group 2.

In addition it prepares for an optimal extension from the top-left shimari
-----]LZ[];B[lb]LZ[];W[md]LZ[];B[ld]LZ[];W[kc]LZ[];B[nc]LZ[];W[le]SQ[le][li]LB[lc:1]C[PJ
-----
Group 1 is stable.

By getting this decently strong group facing his top left enclosure, W has shifted the focus of the game to the top side a little bit. It's looking like one of those "possible territory" areas I mentioned is coming true.

This M15 stone also has a relationship with M11, meaning that if W gets cut, W can look forward to playing something like M13 to loosely connect and build the top left quadrant. Whether W will actually get M13 is a different question, since B has the right to start attacking on the right now, so B will have sente for a while here.

-----
We're more or less settled again, let's count

In terms of solid points, I count 15-20 points for both players, plus W has the beginning of a huge moyo on the top, so it looks like this top right sequence was a huge success for W.

(B does still have one handicap stone that I'm not including in that count though, so B should still be ahead)

Group 1 is solidly behind a sector line, and it doesn't look like it's getting out anytime soon, so it will have to live locally.

Group 2 and 3 are still fighting to get ahead in the centre. If B could surround group 3, all of B's problems would go away, and he would be free to invade or reduce the top or the left. If W could surround group 2, W could build the top and the left on a huge scale, which would probably be game winning.

Overall, I think W is doing better than before, but he still needs to get a better result from the middle fighting in order to really be ahead
-----]LZ[];B[mh]LZ[];W[mi]LZ[]C[DOP
-----
In the current swing of the pendulum, group 6 is strong and group 4 is weak, so group 5 needs to put pressure on 4 in order to get out in sente - this is easier because 3 is stable and 1 isn't alive yet.

W E10 is really well placed I think. If B could capture it on a large scale it would be gg ez, but between the weakness of black group 1, the fact that D6 is never a perfect connection, and how open the black moyo is on both sides, E10 becomes very hard to attack.

K3 is big for endgame (and we're getting close to a time when this really matters).

It's a big reduction of side points for B now, too.

Again E10 is working overtime creating this really nice W position. The fact that black D6 is not a perfect connection means that the black groups 1 and 2 are each behind some sector lines now that K3 was played. This, plus the fact that black group 3 is not completely strong either, means that B can't really expect a lot of territory from the middle

B secures his last loose group (1 + 2), so I think large endgame begins here. Moves after this might still threaten the life and death of groups, but will mainly be focused on points.

Solid points: I count 30-35 for B, and the same amount for W
Potential points: W has the rest of the top moyo to look forward to, and possibly the bottom right ko. B might capture some of W group 1, but it's unclear how much. Overall, it's become a close game after W managed to get group 2 on to the board, combined with E10.
