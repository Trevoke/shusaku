C[PJ
-----
Bottom-left corner is focal point, with left and bottom side both wide open for development.
-----]
;B[ce];W[ci]
C[PJ
-----
Today's theory (2022) would likely suggest going for the empty corner, but this three-space pincer makes the left side less interesting to develop, which tries to get ahead of B's stone placement in the corner.
-----

DOP
-----
Three-space pincers are very loose, so B has a lot of options, but most likely B will tenuki to the last corner to get a big point. It's not worth coming back to this corner until W adds a stone or the board's direction is more developed.

It could be tempting to press here but it turns out W's best answer will be to resist (see variation)

E4 keeps C4 small, while keeping W big.
E4 and R4 are high, so the bottom won't really be territory - W wants to fight. However, it *does* have territory potential.
-----

DOP
-----
The box is not as scary as it seems because E4 and R4 are high.
B will be content to take territory (consistent with current strategy) by sliding at E3, and will continue from there to reduce the potential territory.

C[PJ
-----
Group 1 is ok; not heavy, can still be treated lightly, though that needs to be part of overall strategy.
-----

DOP
-----
The choice of D5 over X suggests that Black is preparing to attack the white stone with A.
-----

Reading
-----
The most common move for B would be C6 to expand the corner or D6 for the same reason. D6 leaves a weakness that W can exploit (see variation). 

Playing D5 prepares B for a move toward the center at F6, for example while still preventing W from sealing B into the corner.
-----]
(;W[op]TR[ip][jq]
C[PJ
-----
None of W's groups are weak.

Right side development will be contested.

Creating an enclosure at P4 stabilizes the corner and indirectly helps the F3 group. 

Any move B plays to pincer W's stones around the J4, K3 area will be less effective in attacking F3 due to the more constrained area. 
-----

DOP
-----
If W gets one more move on the bottom, W builds significant strength.

B can not allow W to convert the K3 area into territory by allowing another move in the area, so an attack on F3 is still the most valuable. This attack will be a bit more severe because B played D5 earlier rather than a low extension at C6.
-----]
;B[jq]
C[PJ
-----
B has somewhat miai between pressuring F3 and making a base towards P4.

Bottom is now broken.

;W[lq]
C[PJ

K3 is pressured. The bottom is unstable, and it is urgent for both to play there.

C[PJ

Group 1 is pressured.
B H3 is stable.
-----]
;W[fn]
C[PJ
-----
B needs to respond on the left side or be sealed in and lose stone efficiency.
-----

DOP
-----
The jump toward the center follows the natural flow of W pushing K3 toward F3 and W moving outward toward C11. 
If W counterattacks the H3 group immediately a B follow-up from D5 to F6 can dictate the flow of the game. 

W can avoid this by moving outward before striking back.

K5 makes giraffe face from triangle stones and elephant jump from square stone. The elephant eye is not reinforced (which would be at M6 or N5) so it's possible to step through it.

Group 1 has lost a direction to move from.
-----

DOP
-----
B has to flee, obviously. He'd rather not help W's shape by making exchanges around X. They could be aji keshi and help W to connect to the western group.

;B[kp]LB[ko:B][ln:A][lo:C][lp:E][mo:D]
C[PJ
-----
Splitting W group from W base.
-----

DOP
-----
Because W has strengthened the F3 group already, B's strongest resistance to being sealed in is to push through the elephant jump at L4, splitting W and threatening to move out to safety.

W has several options to choose B's direction. A and B focused on the center (the difference between A and B is reading). E and D prioritize the right side. C leaves the decision to B.

We end up with A or D as candidates.

D plays from a strong group and doesn't build much more meaningful thickness.
A plays from weakness, and generates slightly more potential thickness, so it's a better option.
-----]
(;W[ln]
C[PJ
-----
Elephant eye is reinforced.
-----

DOP
-----
M6 dictates B's push toward the right rather than into the center because it is easier for B to disconnect the 2 space jump between M3 and M6 than to disconnect the knight's move between K5 and M6. (see variation).

The alternative defense at N5 encourages B to push toward the center, which is weaker than the lower right corner.
-----]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[ho]MA[io]
C[PJ
-----
This is why B didn't want to exchange at X, even though it could've made him an eye. He favored a more aggressive defence.

W F6 group is separated from other W stones.
W K5/M6 stones are effectively floating.
B H3 stones are stable.

W now wants to lean on the strong B group in the corner to support his weaker F4 group.
-----


DOP
-----
When W leans on the C8 stone B has the options of resistance at A to connect or B to split W's C11 stone.

B could also decide to ignore this and attack the floating K5/M6 stones with a further splitting move around C, however these stones have many directions to run and are close to W's strong corner stones. 

Moves around D are also likely forcing for B, but being sandwiched between W's stones will gain B little while strengthening W toward the center.

B also has the option to fight back with the cuts at E6 or E7. The cut at E7 is available because the ladder continues to B's enclosure in the upper right (see variation).

W is forced to exchange more strength, undermining the attack on the C15 stone, as well as damaging any influence W would make around E14.

DOP
-----
B now has 3 targets to attack.

Attacking group 1 has the added benefit of helping B's C15 stone and possibly gaining a large territory along the side. This may also give B strength to return to an attack on the group 2 later. 

Further attacking group 2 is now a bit difficult, but still possible. It would become a running fight and at some point the L8 stone could become cut off in the center. 

Attacking group 3 is a bit difficult because of the open area that W is facing, and B may become over concentrated if W sacrifices the stones to build a strong position along the side.

This is not yet a ko - not until W plays at R12 to challenge the connection.

Strategically, the shift in board balance for this ko is that if W wins, the five B stones would be floating, and suddenly W would have quite the moyo.

Locally the best move for W is just to extend up at O16. At this point in the game, all the questions are on the board, so all variations need to solve the ko on the right, handle W's potential center-left territory, close the bottom right corner, and figure out what's going to happen on the center-right.

C[This fight appeared most famously, and perhaps earliest, in Jowa vs Yonezo, 1821 (see Michael Redmond's review: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1452378595).

It reappeared in Shuwa vs Ota Yuza, 1844, and in Shuho vs Ozawa Mitsugoro, 1859, though it's worth noting it came from a different setup in that game.

And later in Shusai vs Sugioka Eijiro, 1889.

Since all those games included a member of the Honinbo school, in the period 1821-1889, we can guess that Shusaku could've had some familiarity with this position.
