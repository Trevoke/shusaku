;B[ce];W[ci]LB[cc:A][dd:B][ed:C][ee:E][fd:D][fe:F][gc:G]
C[PJ
-----
Today's theory (2022) would likely suggest going for the empty corner, but this three-space pincer makes the left side less interesting to develop, which tries to get ahead of B's stone placement in the corner.
-----

DOP
-----
Black probably has many options here, from jumping to counterpincering to more sophisticated ideas like B. He could also play away.

C[PJ
-----
Group 1 is ok; not heavy, can still be treated lightly, though that needs to be part of overall strategy.
-----

DOP
-----
The choice of D5 over X suggests that Black is preparing to attack the white stone with A.
-----

Reading
-----
The most common move for B would be C6 to expand the corner or D6 for the same reason. D6 leaves a weakness that W can exploit (see variation). 

Playing D5 prepares B for a move toward the center at F6, for example while still preventing W from sealing B into the corner.
-----]
(;W[op]TR[ip][jq]
C[PJ
-----
None of W's groups are weak.

Right side development will be contested.

Creating an enclosure at P4 stabilizes the corner and indirectly helps the F3 group. 

Any move B plays to pincer W's stones around the J4, K3 area will be less effective in attacking F3 due to the more constrained area. 
-----

DOP
-----
If W gets one more move on the bottom, W builds significant strength.

B can not allow W to convert the K3 area into territory by allowing another move in the area, so an attack on F3 is still the most valuable. This attack will be a bit more severe because B played D5 earlier rather than a low extension at C6.
-----]
;B[jq]
C[PJ
-----
B has somewhat miai between pressuring F3 and making a base towards P4.

Bottom is now broken.

;W[lq]
C[PJ

K3 is pressured. The bottom is unstable, and it is urgent for both to play there.

C[PJ

Group 1 is pressured.
B H3 is stable.
-----]
;W[fn]
C[PJ
-----
B needs to respond on the left side or be sealed in and lose stone efficiency.
-----

DOP
-----
The jump toward the center follows the natural flow of W pushing K3 toward F3 and W moving outward toward C11. If W counterattacks the H3 group immediately a B follow-up from D5 to F6 can dictate the flow of the game. W can avoid this by moving outward before striking back.

Group 2 will want to get strong without reinforcing group 1.

;W[jo]TR[fn][fp]SQ[lq]MA[io]LB[fq:2][jq:1]
C[PJ

K5 makes giraffe face from triangle stones and elephant jump from square stone. The elephant eye is not reinforced (which would be at M6 or N5) so it's possible to step through it.

Group 1 has lost a direction to move from.
-----

DOP
-----
Black has to flee, obviously. He'd rather not help White's shape by making exchanges around X. They could be aji keshi and help White to connect to the western group.

Splitting W group from W base.
-----

DOP
-----
Because W has strengthened the F3 group already, B's strongest resistance to being sealed in is to push through the elephant jump at L4, splitting W and threatening to move out to safety.

W has several options to choose B's direction. A and B focused on the center (the difference between A and B is reading). E and D prioritize the right side. C leaves the decision to B.
-----]
(;W[ln]
C[PJ
-----
Elephant eye is reinforced.
-----

DOP
-----
M6 dictates B's push toward the right rather than into the center because it is easier for B to disconnect the 2 space jump between M3 and M6 than to disconnect the knight's move between K5 and M6. (see variation).

The alternative defense at N5 encourages B to push toward the center, which is weaker than the lower right corner.
-----]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[ho]
C[PJ
-----
This is why Black didn't want to exchange at X, even though it could've made him an eye. He favoured a more aggressive defence.

W F6 group is separated from other W stones.
W K5/M6 stones are effectively floating.
B H3 stones are stable.

W now wants to lean on the strong B group in the corner to support his weaker F4 group.
-----


DOP
-----
When W leans on the C8 stone B has the options of resistance at A to connect or B to split W's C11 stone. B could also decide to ignore this and attack the floating K5/M6 stones with a further splitting move around C, however these stones have many directions to run and are close to W's strong corner stones. Moves around D are also likely forcing for B, but being sandwiched between W's stones will gain B little while strengthening W toward the center.

B also has the option to fight back with the cuts at E6 or E7. The cut at E7 is available because the ladder continues to B's enclosure in the upper right (see variation).

B keeps W split
B emerges into the center
W is only alive in the bottom right corner

The loose pincer at C11 and the B strength at D8 mean that E16 is not quite severe enough to warrant an immediate response in the upper left from B.

AI says K8 is about 2 points better but that might be a reading thing.

;W[fk]
C[DOP

Because W did not connect over around K8, W has now been forced into a single option to fight for life with the center group. W must again lean against B's left side stones in order to search for life or movement further toward the center.

W is forced to exchange more strength, undermining the attack on the C15 stone, as well as damaging any influence W would make around E14.
-----

DOP
-----
B now has 3 targets at A, B, and C to attack. Attacking the A stone has the added benefit of helping B's C15 stone and possibly gaining a large territory along the side. This may also give B strength to return to an attack on the B group later. Further attacking the B group is now a bit difficult, but still possible. It would become a running fight and at some point the L8 stone could become cut off in the center. Attacking the C group is a bit difficult because of the open area that W is facing, and B may become over concentrated if W sacrifices the stones to build a strong position along the side.

This is not yet a ko - not until W plays at R12 to challenge the connection.

Strategically, the shift in board balance for this ko is that if W wins, the five B stones would be floating, and suddenly W would have quite the moyo.
On the other hand, if B wins, the W stones would find themselves floating (albeit in a slightly better position since they have friends on the other side of the board).

Locally the best move for W is just to extend up at O16. At this point in the game, all the questions are on the board, so all variations need to solve the ko on the right, handle W's potential center-left territory, close the bottom right corner, and figure out what's going to happen on the center-right.

The recommended AI moves here are D6 and L7, with essentially the same variation as before.
