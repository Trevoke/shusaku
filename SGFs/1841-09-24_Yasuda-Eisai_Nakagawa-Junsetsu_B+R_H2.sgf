W contests the corner. The following sequence can end with W living in the corner and C6 left alone.
This is probably one of the few truly sente moves on the board.
-----

HISTORY
-----
It's interesting to note that this move is typically presented as the "refutation" of G3, and the reason that it moved to F3 in the shin fuseki period of the 1930s. It's said that the 3-3 invasion is too easy, and players facing G3 today are usually advised to dive in immediately. 

Since players of the 1840s clearly knew that C3 was a playable move, their perception of G3 was apparently based on their evaluation of the result of the C3 invasion, not ignorance of its possibility.

B can descend at F2 here; if B can follow-up, B can kill the corner.
This means F2 is often sente and the corner is ~6 points, and can live in ko

C[HISTORY
-----
Waltheri suggests that (25), the hane, was a short lived trend from 1835 to 1846, maybe 1849. Call that range 1830-1850, since Waltheri is nowhere near complete. In 1835 and 1937, two players used it against Shuwa, first Hiki Genjiro and then Hayashi Hakuei. In 1840, Shuwa took the hint and played it against Ito Showa. This Shusaku game is from the year after that, and the first game that didn't involve Shuwa. I suspect that Shuwa, as Shusaku's teacher, introduced the move to him.

Shusaku used it twice more, in 1844 and 1846. The only game involving neither Shuwa nor Shusaku was Hayashi Hakuei vs Sakaguchi Sentoku II, 1844 (apart from one outlier from the 1970s)

interestingly, Waltheri's incidences of the ordinary (outward turn) taisha also peak in 1840-50, between it having no appearances in both the previous and following decades

Shusaku played another game against Nakagawa Junsetsu, in the same year (I guess later), and in that game Nakagawa played the jump (27) without the hane exchange. This is the only instance Waltheri has of a "raw" jump. However, it was the dominant move in the hane exchange line (six games vs three for the turn); so I think we can make a fairly concrete speculation that the point of the hane exchange was considered to be to set up the jump in some way.

Shusaku's (28) was not the main move, which was to connect. The only other person who played Shusaku's move was Ito Showa, in his game against Shuwa. This strengthens the argument that Shusaku was taught this variation by Shuwa. In 1835 and 1837, Shuwa had also been playing the connection, so the push up was an improvement that he'd thought he'd found, or at least a tricky Honinbo secret move. 

all the way up to and including (35) is the same as in Ito Showa vs Shuwa, 1840, from the year before this Shusaku game. The divergence is that Shusaku played (36) D11 where Shuwa played D10

The above "preferred variation" is eerily similar to how Shuwa played in the game from May 12th, 1840  (you can find it here: https://blog.trevoke.net/shusaku/#progress )

The AI, when prodded more gently, considers this a mistake because it leads to a path (almost followed in the main variation) where B can seal in W.

Now W is in real risk of being sealed in, which would really hurt group 1 and the C6 stone.
By contrast, the group 2 has 5 liberties, so they're fine. They are undercut but they can reach for a base, and have forcing moves around F16.
Group 3 can harass group 1, so it's fine too.

Here B makes a "mistake" and allows W to not get sealed in. 
This move also removes W's A18 potential for creating a ko, which would help the bottom left.

Comparing the variations, we do find that the main game keeps the center more open, whereas the AI-suggested variation would lead to a running fight.

B can afford this inefficiency to keep the game simpler, because of the two-stone handicap.

Group 6: has no eyes and no base, and no means of extending onto a side. However, has good shape and a large area.

Group 7: a 4-4, so naturally threatened by the possibility of a 3-3 invasion. But for now it can extend to the south, along the right side.

groups 8, 9: entering combat. Unsettled.
