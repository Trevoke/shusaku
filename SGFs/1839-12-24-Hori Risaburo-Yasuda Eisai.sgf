A large pincer gives room for a base, while keeping c4 and c15 separated.
-----

DOP
-----
The large pincer only applies light pressure on B, so B has the option to tenuki. This means there are many possible follow-ups for both players, depending on desired strategy.
-----]
;B[eq]
C[PJ
-----
B's bottom-left shimari is contested by C11 so development is less interesting.

This means the shimary here will be used for another purpose, likely a settled base for fighting.

P17 keeps the triangle stones disconnected, even though they have line of sight.

DOP
-----
W emphasizes top for territory.

B's options are to contest the top, the right side, or add to the left side. 

The bottom is hard to develop because of E3 and Q3.

Reinforcement for C15

Wing extension from C4 shimari

Extending developmental value of bottom, which is disfavored by both players right now (Q3 and E3 are low)

Right side has the most tension.

;W[ed]
C[DOP
-----
The kosumi is the perenially flexible follow-up from a komoku.

Here it offers the option of extending around J17 or covering at D14. W would be satisfied with covering C15 and getting thickness.

C[PJ
-----
A is in bad shape.
B can continue attacking operations from the left side by way of B10, but is it the most important?

With H17, W settles effectively the three stones at the top
-----

DOP
-----
Now that this group is settled, the next big direction question is about the string of stones at B. They can move up to seal B, they can move down to press on B's framework, they can go to the center to radiate and make most whole-board development very difficult.

;B[bj]
C[PJ
-----
B10 strengthens the lone stone with the peep while keeping sente.

It also makes the W group much heavier.
-----

DOP
-----
From a tactical perspective, this makes the follow-up (E9) a stronger shape, harder to cut, so it's harder for W to step in at e.g. C7 later.

;W[bi]TR[bj][ck]
C[PJ
-----
B framework on lower left is getting stronger.
C11 group is getting quite heavy.
D14 group can live but also doesn't want to get sealed.

The danger of getting sealed in is that it would translate to a lot of power for W on the outside.

If B is sealed in, W gets a ton of strength towards the center.

Reading

W plays at the vital point of B's 3 stone wall with a knight's move from A to B. The knight's move can be cut but will result in W moving into the middle with the A group.

Q15 starts a moyo for W

W can also wedge at D9 (or peep at D8) since B needs to connect the ko (there are no ko threats in the opening) and this leads to a much simpler game variation, which looks like what W wanted all along.

B has a very large corner and large territory lead. W needs his influence to be useful here to compensate.
-----

DOP
-----
Many ways for W to go here next.
A, B, C, D, E are directional options for W.

A is one of the preferred choices for the AI.

One way to exploit this board position for W is to aim towards a moyo more directly by playing at B instead. It keeps the game slightly simpler.

This way W doubles down on the press and takes the corner to catch back up the territory balance.
There's room for B to make a ko, but B might not want it.
In addition, this begins a wall facing the right side.
-----

DOP
-----
for B here, the correct area is now the bottom right corner. This is because all of W's influence is top left, so to contest it indirectly we start here.
