A bit too far from F3 to be a base, but coordinates well with R4 to make it more difficult for B to step around P3 effectively.

Historic

In modern go, the move order to lead to a similar board position is different, ending with F3-D3 exchange.]
;B[oq]
C[PJ
-----
B is forcing W to choose a direction for his stones instead of getting a single unified framework.

This move also threatens the life of the three-space extension on the left side.
-----ㅤ​]
(;W[op]
C[DOP
-----
W needs to choose between developing the right side, and hurting the bottom two stones, or preserving the two stones, and potentially damaging the right side. Since the two stones are an investment, they are also hard to sacrifice lightly at the moment.
-----]
;B[np]
(;W[pq]LB[fq:1][jq:2]
C[PJ
-----
Q3 makes it hard for B to make a base, but gives B the opportunity to move towards the center.
-----

DOP
-----
W can go towards the corner with Q3 or do what we are used today with P5. Both are fine choices, and P5 is better according to the AI. However, P5 would give B the opportunity to squirrel his way into a base and damage the two W stones.
-----

Reading
-----
The variation with P5 may lead to force W to strengthen the 1,2 stones and break the right
-----]
;B[oo];W[pp];B[no]
C[PJ
-----
Here B makes the first real direct choice in option for a center position over the side.

In general in handicap games with 3+ stones control of the center for W is really important

By taking this direction away, we can see B is opting to make things harder on W not only by staying ahead in terms of points, but by also contesting center control
-----]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[or];B[qn]
C[PJ
-----
This move seals the W group in (at the cost of a push-and-cut aji at Q5) and threatens a follow-up on the right side that would give B good profit and make W's R14 stone scramble.

The W group is alive and the corner is a respectable size, so W does not need to worry about this part of the exchange.
-----]
;W[ql]
C[PJ
-----
W must extend on the right side. The left side is bigger, but it is dominated by B, and the right side is the area where W can make a base.

B's thickness is threatened.

Leaning again to develop the center

(;W[qk]
C[PJ

B is strong in this area so W simply wants to create a position on the right. The hane at Q9 would invite fighting in an area where black has the advantage.
----

Reading
-----
If W hane instead, see variations, B will have options
-----]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[oj];W[pi];B[oi];W[ph]
C[PJ
-----
Allowing either the hane at Q12 or some sort of inside attack will leave W with poor shape and short liberties, so while W Q12 may seem small, it prevents W from being bullied further on the right.

W stabilizes in exchange of B presence in the center.
-----]
;B[pm]LB[lq:B][nk:A]
C[PJ
-----
B's Bottom left is, generously, 18 points
W's Right side is, generously, 14 points
+ W's corner: 11 points

W up by 7 or so.

This exchange gave B thickness, which looms over F3 and K3.

W has forcing moves here at A and B.

Both groups on the right are settled and not only is the D16 stone in the corner, it is flanked by the most open sides in either direction (8 spaces). An approach on D16 is both a corner play, and the most open side.
-----
ㅤㅤ
DOP
-----
It's time for W to start working to reduce B's framework.

;W[fc]
C[PJ
-----
Stones on the fourth line are for influence, not territory, so this stays reasonable: creating the opportunity for more points.

C[PJ

B takes an in-between move to create a better shape for thickness before coming back to W's approach.

;W[rf]TR[qc]
C[PJ

The descent opens aji in the corner, which correspondingly reduces the potential of the B stones.
-----]
;B[jc]
C[PJ
-----
An early sign of Shusaku's preference for "balance": here he applies very very light pressure to the white stone, while managing the territory balance, and still maintaining center control.

This doesn't secure top right but it forces a direction for W.

C[PJ
-----
W needs to help the three marked areas.

W has forcing moves around A and at B.
-----]
;W[ic]
C[PJ
-----
The top left is unsettled for both. W is leaning on the relative strength of the top-right corner to build strength to work on the D16 and D14 groups, which would be weaker after this exchange.
-----]
(;B[ib]
C[PJ
-----

I think it's a matter of maintaining timing, here. There's a cut at D15 which could give W the corner, or at least a strong group on the left side. We can't let W get that, so we offer to settle very simply. Settling simply would give B sente, though, so W can't choose that path.
-----

DOP
-----
An interesting choice here, normally the hane above is consistent with B's plan (see variation).

If B ends with sente, B will likely close the top-left and squeeze the top W group, or expand the top right... And squeeze the top W group.

Thanks for the territory.
This solid move is also important as a foundation for future fighting on the top.

W's stones can barely be called thickness, as they are very disconnected, and run straight into B's P11 stones.

Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 are floating: they don't have a base.

Extending group 4 this way continues the fight. Liberty management matters. 
Group 2 keeps W split and forces W to defend two groups.

A somewhat dangerous plan for B. As B attacks, W will get stronger, affecting the strength of B on both sides. This is in fine balance with the relative strength of groups 3 and 4. If W finds an opening, the connection at M16 could be dangerous for B.
