W framework is thin compared to B.

C11 reduces the flexibility of the D15 stone, which means its value on the board is reduced.

C11 is too far from C6 to consider that the stones are connected.
-----

DOP
-----
B is too weak on top and bottom to make splitting the left side W stones worth it, but that can change.

Must leverage D15 now using the "miai direction" from C11.

      C[PJ
-----
By allowing W to push through at N5 instead of blocking, further moves in the area will essentially be an extension of W's strong corner group. If B blocked, even though the cut at N4 would be dangerous, W's stones would be cut off from the strong group, making a more even balance of strength.

D10 counterattacks the D6 stones, works well with D15 and F16.

Also acts as pressure on group 1.
-----

DOP
-----
W can build strength with kikashi first: the right time to invade is right before an area becomes territory. It would also be nice if the bottom stones didn't become useful strength in the fight on the left.

Split at the shape point. Both groups are fine independently.
-----

Reading
-----
If B goes to K5, W can live in the corner while B builds significant influence

If B tenuki (e.g. Q17) then W can start to build a loose framework targeting the D10 stone, but it can become a large fight.

Katago wants to shore up the weakness in the bottom wall then develop strength on the right and top.

The bottom wall weakness is urgent for both because, basically, whoever plays there gets nice shape and gives the opponent bad shape (fix aji / create aji)

W is leaning on B to gain more strength to get the C11 stone out.

B pushes to keep W's D13 group floating. This is likely the last move B can play on this side before W is strengthened enough to counterattack the D10 stones.

The good news is, B's group is now stable.
-----

DOP
-----
W doesn't have a lot of good options here: if C11 gets sealed in, B will get a lot of territory and it'll be very hard to catch up.
-----

Reading
-----
B should just take the kikashi at F4 instead. 

W will tenuki from sadness and save C11 but it's a small target compared to the unstable groups that W has in the Southwest area
